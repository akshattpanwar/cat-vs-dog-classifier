# cat-vs-dog-classifier
A basic image classifier built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python to distinguish between cat and dog images. Built with TensorFlow and OpenCV.
# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier 🐶🐱

This project is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using PyTorch to classify images of cats and dogs. It includes training, validation, and model-saving logic along with the Lion optimizer.

## 🧠 Features
- Custom CNN architecture
- Uses Lion optimizer
- Model saves best and final checkpoints
- Basic data automation for training and validation

## 🚀 Run the Model
```bash
python main.py
